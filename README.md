# Supply-Chain-Management
Optimizing the Supply Chain: A Data-Driven Approach for Enhanced Efficiency and Performance

## Problem Statement
An FMCG company entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a miss match in the demand and supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and where the demand is low, supply is pretty high. In both ways, it is an inventory cost loss to the company; hence, the higher management wants to optimize the supply quantity in every warehouse in the entire country.
